# Overview of the school district analysis
## The purpose of this analysis is to determine how inaccurate reading and math scores at Thomas High School have altered the results of the previous school district analysis completed.

## - Replacing ninth graders' math and reading scores affects Thomas High School's performance relative to other schools as we can see from the previous images. The changing of these scores has resulted in Thomas High School being the lowest scoring performing school due to the % Passing Math, % Passing Reading, and % Percent Overall Passing rates. A couple other schools scored lower in these categories, but Thomas High School is just below 70% in all of these categories; therefore the lowest performing school across the board.
## - Replacing ninth-grade scores affects math and reading scores by grade because all of the ninth grade scores for Thomas High School are removed from the calculations. Therefore, we are not about to accurately measure Thomas High School's performance as a whole.
## - Since Thomas High School's falsely reported grades were dropped from the calculations, we are unable to determine how replacing ninth-grade scores has affected scores by school spending.
## - Since Thomas High School's falsely reported grades were dropped from the calculations, we are unable to determine how replacing ninth-grade scores has affected scores by school size.
## - Since Thomas High School's falsely reported grades were dropped from the calculations, we are unable to determine how replacing ninth-grade scores has affected scores by school type.
